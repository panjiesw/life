title: "2016 - Year of Yummy JS Dev Spaghetti"
---

This is about what I've been doing for the past year.
I was tasked to research about frontend webapp development at my work. Not that it's entirely new to me, but 2016 was
the most intensive, full of tinkering and scratched structures.

Coincidentally last year, a lot of new features began to be widely used, namely `ES2015`,
also the even newer `ES6` and `ES7`. A lot of libraries out there began to use arrow functions,
class and inheritance syntax, the new module system, etc.

They are the new standard set for the future of javascript language.
Not all of them are officially reached a stable stage, I know. Every browser platform also has their own timeline and
no one knows exactly when all of these features are to be widely implemented in our nowadays popular browsers.

Despite all of that, people are still eager to use them in their projects, including me. That's why libraries and
polyfills which help usage of the new features in current projects are also transforming for the better.
Bundler like [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) began to support and
can even optimize them. Meanwhile newer bundler like [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) and
[Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) specifically come to support new standards as
the default. Polyfills also help us transition into the new features while maintaining usage across wide browser platform.

The downside? They are new, as in lack of proper documentation. You have to really dig around the web to find how
to use it properly. A lot of blog posts help, but not few of them even direct us to a potentially wrong path.
For example Webpack 2.x. They just recently set up a [new doc site](https://webpack.js.org), but before,
people find it hard to use the new configuration and make things work.
It's a major release, of course, and it's still an RC. But it's a fun adventure nonetheless, at least for me.

> It's new and shiny. It helps make javascript development easier.

It's like spaghetti, but still yummy.

Maybe I'll post about some new features of Webpack 2.x sometime. It's the tool I use the most and as I said, it's fun. :)
